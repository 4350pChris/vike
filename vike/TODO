- Update boilerplates to not use PageContextBuiltIn but Vike.PageContext instead
- Improve https://vike.dev/header-file
- Update all examples to not use PageContextBuiltIn but Vike.PageContext instead

- fix pageContext._renderHook.hookFilePath / replace with new prop hookSrc
- refacor/fix skipConfigValue to differentiate between global/page virtual file
- use json-s instead of JSON
- replace configValueSources with configValues for global configs
  - maybe add a _isGlobal option

- Set env type to `{ client: boolean | 'eager', server: boolean | 'eager', config?: boolean }`
  - Eager means that the value is always loaded, no matter what page is being loaded. (By default only the values of the page being renderered are loaded.)
  - Should the option be '_eager' and internal? Is there any added value to make it internal? Custom configs are only meant for advanced use cases anyways. Maybe naming it 'eager' (instead of '_eager') while omitting 'eager` in the Meta type until some user needs it?
  - Values that are defined in `+config.h.js` are loaded at config-time even if `config: false`. (But they can be defined in a `+{configName}.js` and they won't be loaded then.)
    - But they can still be lazily loaded in the client/server runtime
  - Global page config values are always eager

- improve ignoring of dist/
- client/shared/
  client/runtime-server-routing/
  client/runtime-client-routing/
  client/router.js

   - pageContext.config
   - pageContext.configEntries

Implement vike.config.js
