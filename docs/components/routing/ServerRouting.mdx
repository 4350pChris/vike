Server(-side) Routing is the "old school way" of doing routing:
when the user navigates to a new page,
the old page is completely discarded and the HTML of the new page is loaded.

The advantage of Server Routing is that it leads to a significantly simpler architecture. The drawback is that some use cases aren't implementable with Server Routing.
