## Can I reach out for help?

Yes, you can reach out on Discord and GitHub. If you use GitHub Discussions, then you'll always get an answer from a Vike team member.


## Can I use Vike to achieve what I want?

Vike praises itself of being a highly (if not the most) flexible frontend framework: if you stumble upon a use case you believe you cannot achieve with Vike then [let us know](https://github.com/vikejs/vike/discussions).


## Why is CSS leaked to other pages?

With <Link href="/client-routing">Client Routing</Link>, when navigating from one page to another, the CSS of the previous page isn't removed. This means the CSS of the previous page will also apply to the next page.

In a nutshell: CSS is leaky.

For example:

```jsx
// /pages/terms-of-service/+Page.jsx

import './style.css'

export const Page = () => <>
  <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
  <div id="terms-of-service">
    {/* ... */}
  </div>
</>
```

```css
/* /pages/terms-of-service/style.css */

/* ❌ Bad: the CSS selector `body` can apply to any page. */
body {
  font-size: 0.8em;
}
```

Narrow down the CSS selector instead:

```css
/* /pages/terms-of-service/style.css */

/* ✅ Good: the CSS selector #terms-of-service only applies to the "Terms of Service" page. */
#terms-of-service {
  font-size: 0.8em;
}
```

> If you use **Vue** with `.vue` files, then Vue already scopes the CSS for you: the CSS you define in a `.vue` file is guaranteed to apply only to the component defined in that `.vue` file.

> If you use **React** or **Solid**, then we recommend using inline styles and/or CSS-in-JS libraries (or Tailwind), while minimizing global CSS. Inline style aren't global and, therfore, aren't leaky.

> **CSS is injected by Vite** in the form of `<style>` tags. If you're curious why Vite doesn't remove old `<style>` tags, consider that removing CSS is problematic during the transient state upon page navigation (it would lead to [FOUC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_of_unstyled_content)). In general, regardless of Vite's behavior, it's a good practice to narrow down CSS selectors.


## Why are there a lot of HTTP requests in dev?

In development, you may observe a lot of HTTP requests fetching a lot JavaScript files.
That's because <Link href="/lazy-transpiling">Vite does lazy transpiling</Link>.

While it's true that doing a lot of HTTP requests slows down page load (and Vite is working on optimizing that aspect), Vite's lazy transpiling approach enables unparalleled development speed.


## How can I contribute and/or support?

Contributions in forms of [code](https://github.com/vikejs/vike/issues/1349) and/or [sponsoring](https://github.com/vikejs/vike/issues/1350) are much welcome.
