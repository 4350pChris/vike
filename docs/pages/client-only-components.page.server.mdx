You can render a component only on the client-side by wrapping it with a `<ClientOnly>` component.

```jsx
<ClientOnly>
  <SomeComponent />
</ClientOnly>
```

> Alternatively, you can disable SSR and render the page as SPA instead (while rendering other pages with SSR). See <Link href="/render-modes" />.

Common use cases:

 - **Library components that don't support SSR**. A solution is to render/load the component only on the client-side.
   > Most component libraries nowadays support SSR but some don't. Some even crash when they're merely loaded on the server-side (for example, when libraries have hard references to browser-only APIs/objects such as `window`).
 - **Performance**. By using `<ClientOnly>` with a [dynamic `import()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/import), you can defer loading heavy components, such as a complex interactive map. That way, your users can already interact with your page before even the browser starts loading that heavy component.
   > Vite automatically code-splits `const { SomeComponent } = await import('some-library')`. In other words, the code of `<SomeComponent />` isn't included in the initial JavaScript client-side bundle: it's loaded only when and if `import()` is executed.


## React

Use <Link text="ClientOnly" href="/ClientOnly" /> component.

Here is an simple example of how to use the `ClientOnly` to wrap a dynamically loaded component:

```jsx
import { ClientOnly } from 'vike-react/ClientOnly'

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <ClientOnly load={() => import('path-to-dynamic-component')} fallback={<Loading />}>
      {(Component) => <Component {...props} />}
    </ClientOnly>
  )
}
```
