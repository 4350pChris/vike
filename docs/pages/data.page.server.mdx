The `data()` hook is used for fetching data, see <Link href="/data-fetching" />.

> For a lower-level hook with more control, see <Link href="/onBeforeRender" />.


## Initial `pageContext` values

You can set initial `pageContext` values, such as information about the authenticated user, at <Link text={<code>renderPage(pageContextInit)</code>} href="/renderPage" />. See <Link href="/auth" />.

> For <Link href="/pre-rendering" >pre-rendered</Link> apps, see [#962 - New hook `onStartup()`](https://github.com/vikejs/vike/issues/962).


## Server-side

By default, the `data()` hook always runs the server-side. Thus you can directly use ORM/SQL database queries:

```js
// /pages/movies/+data.js

export { data }

// Note how we use `node-fetch`; this file is only run on the server-side, thus we don't need
// to use an isomorphic (aka universal) implementation such as `cross-fetch`.
import fetch from 'node-fetch'

async function data(pageContext) {
  const response = await fetch("https://api.imdb.com/api/movies/")
  const { movies } = await response.json()
  /* Or with an ORM:
  const movies = Movie.findAll() */
  /* Or with SQL:
  const movies = sql`SELECT * FROM movies;` */
  return {
    movies
  }
}
```


## Client-side

By default, `data()` always runs on the server-side.

But,
by using `meta`,
you can tell Vike to run `data()` also on the client-side: Vike calls `data()` on the server-side for the first page the user visits
and then, for subsequent page navigations, Vike calls `data()` on the client-side.

See <Link href="/meta#example-modify-data-env" doNotInferSectionTitle />.

In general, we recommend running `data()` only on the server-side because it's usually easier to write code that only runs on the server-side.
That said, if you want to minimize requests made to your server, then it makes sense to run `data()` on the client-side.
Keep in mind that you'll have to make sure that your `data()` hook is isomorphic: it needs to be able to run on the server-side as well as on the client-side.

You can also set `data()`'s meta config `env` to `{ client: true, server: false}`: Vike will then always call `data()` on the client-side and never on the server-side.
