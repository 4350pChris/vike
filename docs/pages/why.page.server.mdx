## Optional Control

A core belief of Vike is what we call *optional control*: you begin with a full-fledged and zero-config setup that allows you to quickly ship prototypes, while later, if the need arises as you scale, you can eject and take control of integration code that was initially hidden from you.

Start quickly, optionally take over when needed.

For example, you can use <Link href="/react#vike-extension">`vike-react`</Link> to get a quick start similar to frameworks like Next.js. Later, at scale, you can stop using `vike-react` and replace it with a fully custom React integration. If you use Vike core without any Vike extension, then you have complete control over how you integrate your favorite tools.
