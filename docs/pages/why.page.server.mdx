## Optional Control

A core belief of Vike is what we call *optional control*: you begin with a full-fledged and zero-config setup enabling you to quickly ship prototypes while later, as the need arises while scaling, you can eject and take control of integration code that was initially hidden from you.

For example, you can use <Link href="/react#vike-extension">`vike-react`</Link> to get a quick start similar to frameworks like Next.js. Later, at scale, you can replace `vike-react` with a custom React integration. If you use Vike Core without any Vike extension, then you have complete control over the integration code of your tools.

Start quick, while optionally take control as the need arises.
