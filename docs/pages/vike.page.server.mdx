  The Vike rename ([#736](https://github.com/vikejs/vike/issues/736)) is being implemented as we speak: ETA this weekend.
  This page will be updated and will contain instructions for how to migrate to Vike.

The vike project has been renamed to Vike ([vike.dev](https://vike.dev/)).

Functionally, nothing changes: it's just a new name for the same tool.

There are no breaking changes, although, starting from version `0.4.142` you'll have to use the [npm package Vike](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vike) instead of the [npm package Vike](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vike). We recommend applying following find-and-replace bash script:
```bash
grep ike --exclude-dir node_modules/ --exclude-dir .git/ | xargs sed -i 's/ike/ike/g'
```

This should do the trick for most users.

> Let us know if this bash script doesn't work out for you.

For more information about the rename see [#736](https://github.com/vikejs/vike/issues/736).
