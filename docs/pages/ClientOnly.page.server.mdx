Environment: browser.

The `ClientOnly` is a component that allows you to defer the rendering of components until they are required only on the client-side.

> This component is currently available through [`vike-react`](https://github.com/vikejs/vike-react) and [`vike-solid`](https://github.com/vikejs/vike-solid).

This is particularly useful for optimizing performance with heavy components, and for components that are meant for client-side only, such as those using browser-specific features.

## React

<ClientOnlyCommon packageName="vike-react" hasDepsArgument={true} />
