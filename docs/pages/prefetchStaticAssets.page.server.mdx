import { Link } from '@brillout/docpress'
import { ViteLazyTranspilingContradiction } from '../components'

```js
// +config.h.js

export default {
  // Default value: 'hover'
  prefetchStaticAssets: 'viewport',
}
```

> The `prefetchStaticAssets` setting only applies to <Link href="/client-routing">Client Routing</Link>.

By default,
the static assets of `/some-url` are loaded as soon as the user hovers his mouse over a link `<a href="/some-url">`.
This means that static assets are often already loaded before even the user clicks on the link.

We can prefetch even more eagerly by using viewport prefetching: the links are then prefetched as soon as they appear in the viewport of the user's browser.

```js
// /renderer/+config.h.js
// Environment: config

export default {
  // Prefetch links as soon as they enter the viewport
  prefetchStaticAssets: 'viewport'

  // Prefetch links when the user's mouse hovers a link
  prefetchStaticAssets: 'hover'

  // Disable prefetching
  prefetchStaticAssets: false
}
```

> Viewport prefetching is disabled in development. (Because it would make Vite transpile all preloaded pages, <ViteLazyTranspilingContradiction />.)


## Override for individual links

To override the setting for individual links: `<a data-prefetch-static-assets="hover" href="/some-url" />` (or `data-prefetch-static-assets="false"` and `data-prefetch-static-assets="viewport"`).


## Programmatic `prefetch()`

We can programmatically <Link text={<code>prefetch('/some/url')</code>} href="/prefetch"/>.

> Only static assets are prefetched: the `pageContext` of pages isn't prefetched, see [#246](https://github.com/vikejs/vike/issues/246).


## Different settings for mobile/desktop

We can viewport prefetch for mobile users while only hover prefetch for desktop users:

```js
// For small screens, such as mobile, viewport prefetching can be a sensible strategy
export const prefetchStaticAssets = window.matchMedia('(max-width: 600px)').matches
  ? 'viewport' : 'hover'
```

```js
// Or we enable viewport prefetching for any device without a mouse: mobile and tablets (but
// not laptops that have a touch display).
export const prefetchStaticAssets = window.matchMedia('(any-hover: none)').matches
  ? 'viewport' : 'hover'
```
